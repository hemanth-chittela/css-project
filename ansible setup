1.	Firstly create a ssh-keygen in the master ansible node as a root user
2.	In the master node as a root go to the sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts and add the following 
[slave]
13.233.201.44 this is public ip of the slave server
Then do ansible -m ping slave we get an error which is expected.
“sudo systemctl restart sshd” this command can be used after adding the server ip details in the hosts file in the master server as a root user
3.	Then in the slave node as a root user go to .ssh folder it will be present there by default on creating the server. 
4.	Then navigate into the .ssh and create a file called authorized_keys and paste the public key in it. This public key is coming from the master ssh-keygen and save it and from the master using ansible -m ping name which would be slave or something which we are giving in the square brackets [slave].
